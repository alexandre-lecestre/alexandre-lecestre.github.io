### Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the label shift quantification problem.
We propose robust estimators of the label distribution which turn out
to coincide with the Maximum Likelihood Estimator. We analyze the
theoretical aspects and derive deviation bounds for the proposed method,
providing optimal guarantees in the well-specified case, along with notable
robustness properties against outliers and contamination. Our results
provide theoretical validation for empirical observations on the robustness
of Maximum Likelihood Label Shift.
